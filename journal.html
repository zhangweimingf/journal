    Isaw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the 
    road today :"[Passing cars, when you can't see, May get 
    you, A glimpse, Of enterinty." I definitely won't be Passing
    any cars.

    My first day of the trip! I can't believe I fianlly got
    everything packed and ready to go. Because I'm on a Segway,
    I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me: cell phone,iPod,
    digital camera, and a protein bar. Just the essentials. As
    Lao Tzu would have said, "A jjourney of a thousand miles begins
    with one Segway."
